						<h2>Problem Space </h2>
						<p>King County reported in 2019 only 3% of our community commutes via bicycle. With a continuous growth of jobs 
							in our county, there is a great need to empower an eco-friendly way to commute. Those who commute have 
							reported that the inconvenience of properly storing their equipment was a large factor in choosing to bike to work. </p>

						<p>The current work process for the leased bicycle lockers is manually processed. This project is geared to increase 
							efficiency in workflow for all levels of technical users in hopes of encouraging the community to sign up for the 
							bike lockers.</p>

					<h2>Next Steps</h2>
					<p>
						As a team, we focused on building the foundational blocks that will help Cascade Bicycle Club 
						achieve a more scaled and automated process of connecting with their community. Due to limited 
						time and resources, our team had to rescope the scale of the project and address specific 
						workstreams to automate. In moving forward, we suggest working towards fully automating the 
						work process such as including online payments and document signatures by utilizing services such as Stripe, 
						Docusign and more. This will not only streamline the process but enhance the user experience.
						We suggest refining the overall user experience as well, such as updating the landing page, 
						 by including more features on the website, or building a mobile friendly application and more. With a 
						 fully developed database, we strongly believe that there is great room for improvements and are excited 
						 to see what becomes of it. 
					</p>

					<p>If you are interested in furthering the project, reach out to Cascade Bicycle Club or the iSchool Capstone teaching 
						team to see if this can be continued on as a capstone project. </p>
